<!-- ipl-cpp by NewForester:  programming notes on and examples in C++ -->

# IPL C++

This repository at present contains:

  * solutions to exercises from the [Exercism C++ Track](https://exercism.io/tracks/cpp).

The solutions resulted from a need to bring my knowledge and experience of C++ up to date.
In particular, to practise C++11 syntax.

In the future it may contain:

  * notes made while studying C++ tutorials;
  * exercises and examples from the tutorials;
  * solutions to exercises found on web sites other than [Exercism](https://exercism.io/tracks/cpp);
  * any other C++ notes, exercises and examples of my own devising.

The notes and exercises would not amount to a management investigation into why an organisation should use C++
but a technical investigation into what you would need to understand in order to begin programming in C++.

While the material here is my own, it owes a great deal to the tutorial(s) and other infromation gleaned from the Internet.
