//
//  The test case that sought the 10001 prime was used as a benchmark.
//
//  The previous iteration was used as a starting point:  ~1.5s.
//
//  Reserving the vector seemed to slow things down.  Using std::list instead
//  of std::vector really slowed things down: ~5s.  Replacing the use of
//  std::any_of with a lamdba also seemed to slow things a little.
//
//  Adding the square optimisation improved matters considerably:  ~30 ms.  All
//  further fiddling made no signficant difference.
//
//  This much faster version still used std::vector but I was fascinated by
//  someone's use of 6nÂ±1.  This considers two candidates per iteration and so
//  tends to run fast but more significant was the claim that it was as fast as
//  std::vector solutions without the memory overhead.
//
//  This seems to be the case for the solution above.  Adding a std::vector
//  back in made no difference.  This was suprising.  Perhaps for much, much
//  larger primes the situation would change but perhaps this will always win
//  if it is small enough to fit into L1 cache memory.
