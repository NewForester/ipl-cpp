# Solutions for the Exercism C++ Track

The code examples in this repository are available under a BSD licence, Copyright (c) 2018 New Forester.

However, the examples in this directory have been uploaded to the Exercism platform,
some before and some after the transition from Exercism V1 to Exercism V2.
The terms of use for the Exercism V2 require users grant Exercism a non-execlusive CC BY-SA licence.
Retro-actively.

The author grants Exercism their licence under their terms of use.

What does this mean for you ?

If you take any solution from the Exercism platform you must attribute the solution to Exercism Inc. and not to the author.
If, on the other hand, you take any code from this repository you must use the BSD licence, which does attribute the code to the author.

__Note:__

The code is as it is and, under the terms of the BSD licence comes, with no warranty.
You are expected and encouraged to modify it to suit your purposes.

In particular, the code uses header files exclusively.
In the general case, na√Øve, as-is, use of these will produce linkage problems.
